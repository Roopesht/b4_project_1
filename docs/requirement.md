Need to build a project, where you will take the user's choices to 
1) see existing conversations
2) Add a conversation
   This has to ask for "from", "message", which gets added as a last message under "conversations"/"name"
3) Respond to all the conversations (if applicable)
   Respond to all the messages, where "from" is not "me". If the last message's "from" is "me", then do not respond.
